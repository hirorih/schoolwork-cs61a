# Tower Defense Game: Ants vs Bees
the game consists of a series of turns.
In each turn, new bees may enter the ant colony. Then, new ants are placed.
Finally, all insects (ants, then bees) take individual actions: bees sting ants, and ants throw leaves at bees.
The game ends either when a bee reaches the ant queen (you lose), or the entire bee flotilla has been vanquished (you win).
